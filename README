Assignment 1


Analysing result of command 'strace WhatIDo 0' (with argument 0) produces the
following system calls:
-------------------------------------------------------------

mkdir("Welcome", 0775)                  = 0

This command creates a directory called "Welcome" with permissions number 0775.
  The return value is 0 means that the command done successfully.


mkdir("Welcome/To", 0775)     = 0

This command creates a directory inside "Welcome" directory named "To" with
permissions number 0775, also successfully.


open("Welcome/To/OS2018", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3

This command opens and creates (0_CREAT) (if doesn't exist) file named "OS2018"
 in folder 'Welcome/To'.
"Welcome/To/OS2018", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666 are the system call
 arguments (flags) :
O_WRONLY - Open with writing only permissions.
O_CREAT - Check if the file exists. In this case this flag has no effect, else
 it creates the file.
O_TRUNC	- if the file exists and is a regular file, and the file has permissions
that allow writing, then its length is truncated to 0. If the file is a FIFO or
terminal device file, this flag is ignored.
0666 permissions - read and write permissions for the file.
3 – system call return value, means that the command was done successfully.


fstat(3, {st_dev=makedev(0, 53), st_ino=1917381310, st_mode=S_IFREG|0644,
 st_nlink=1, st_uid=201797, st_gid=40, st_blksize=65536, st_blocks=0, st_size=0,
  st_atime=2018-04-15T17:01:07+0300.536969000,
   st_mtime=2018-04-15T17:01:07+0300.536969000,
    st_ctime=2018-04-15T17:01:07+0300.536969000}) = 0

*** The fstat() function shall obtain information about an open file associated with
 the file descriptor fildes(3 - which is OS2018), and shall write it to the area
  pointed to by buf.
S_ISREG(m) - checks whether it's a regular file.
The return value is zero meaning the command completed succesfully. ***


write(3, "artyomab\nIf you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it
 right now!\n0", 77) = 77

The Program calls write system call and then tries to write 77 bytes to
 "OS2018" file, the sentence written in the second argument, that is.
3 - file descriptor (OS2018).
77 - amount of bytes to write.
77 - Return value - the number of bytes written. The comment completed
successfully


close(3)= 0

closing the file successfully.
returns zero on success.  else -1.


unlink("Welcome/To/OS2018") = 0

This sys-call deletes the file OS2018 from the file system.
This call succeeded with return value 0.
"Welcome/To/OS2018" - pathname.


rmdir("Welcome/To/") = 0

This function delete a directory.
"Welcome/To/" - is the path name


rmdir("Welcome/") = 0

This function delete a directory.
"Welcome/" is the pathname


exit_group(0)                           = ?

The system call exits all threads from the calling process thread group
 in a process and terminates them.

+++ exited with 0 +++

The final return value of the program is 0.
