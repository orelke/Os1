Assignment 1

A brief description of WhatIDo program as interpreted using 'strace WhatIDo 0' (with argument 0):

1) mkdir("Welcome", 0775)                  = 0

Creates (if doesn't exist) a directory called "Welcome" giving it permission number 0775 in the
current directory. Return value 0 means the command completed successfully.

2) mkdir("Welcome/To", 0775)               = 0

Creates (if doesn't exist) a directory called "To" inside previously created "Welcome" directory,
also giving it permission number 0775. Return value 0 means the command completed successfully.

3) open("Welcome/To/OS2018", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3

This command opens and creates (0_CREAT) (if doesn't exist) file called "OS2018" with write only
permissions. O_TRUNC flag: if the file exists and is a regular file, and the file has permissions
that allow writing, then its length is truncated to 0. If the file is a FIFO or
terminal device file, this flag is ignored.
The return value is 3, meaning that the program was completed successfully and the new file
descriptor value is 3.

4) fstat(3, {st_dev=makedev(0, 53), st_ino=1917381310, st_mode=S_IFREG|0644,
 st_nlink=1, st_uid=201797, st_gid=40, st_blksize=65536, st_blocks=0, st_size=0,
  st_atime=2018-04-15T17:01:07+0300.536969000,
   st_mtime=2018-04-15T17:01:07+0300.536969000,
    st_ctime=2018-04-15T17:01:07+0300.536969000}) = 0

Referencing the new file using its file descriptor value(3), the program obtains information about
this file using fstat command, this command writes this information into a struct residing in the
address sent to fstat by second argument. The values of various fields in this struct are being
presented in the curly brackets. The return value of the command is 0, meaning the command was
completed successfully.

5) write(3, "artyomab\nIf you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!\n0", 77)
 = 77

The Program calls write system call and then writes 77 bytes to "OS2018" file, the string provided
in the second argument, that is. 77 - Return value - the number of bytes written. The command
completed successfully.

6) close(3)= 0

Closes "OS2018" file successfully(0 return value).

7) unlink("Welcome/To/OS2018") = 0

This sys-call deletes the file OS2018 from the file system. If there is still process using this
file, it will be deleted after it stops using it. This call succeeded with return value 0.

8) rmdir("Welcome/To/") = 0

This function deletes the "To" directory inside of "Welcome" directory.

9) rmdir("Welcome/") = 0

This function deletes the "Welcome" directory.

10) exit_group(0)                           = ?

The system call exits all threads from the calling process thread group
 in a process and terminates them.

+++ exited with 0 +++

The final return value of the program is 0.

NOTE:
Some of the commands listed here like (open, mkdir, rmdir ...) need write permissions for the
files/directories in the current directory, otherwise the program will get permission denied error
and will not do all or some of the actions.
